Thanks for taking a look into our code!

## User manual:
- First open mainFourier_ss which is the code that fully computes the snapshot matrix with fourier basis
- If you want to see the results open the plotter.m and run the figures/simulations per section for the things that seem relevant.
- After running mainFourier_ss you can run mainPOD to which automatically defines a POD basis from the pre-ran mainFourier_ss script.
- Keep an eye out for % User-input comments in the scripts these are recommended to change to your liking.
