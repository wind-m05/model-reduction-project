## User manual:
- First open main/mainFourier_ss which is the code that fully computes the snapshot matrix with a Fourier basis
- If you want to see the results open the plotter/plotter.m and run the figures/simulations per section for the things that seem relevant.
- After running mainFourier_ss you can run mainPOD which automatically defines a POD basis from the snapsot matrix in your workspace (from the mainFourier_ss script).
- Keep an eye out for % User-input comments in the scripts these are recommended to change by the user for the specific problem.
